README: Measurement of Net Community Production (MoNCP) of the World's Oceans
(last updated 2013/02/13)

A web application that supports the viewing and analysis of data generated by
the Nicolas Cassar Laboratory of Duke University's Nicholas School of the 
Environment.  From http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/cassar/: "Our
research focuses on environmental biogeochemistry and physiology, with the
objective of constraining the mechanisms governing carbon cycling and climate."

* Time Sliders ("Start Year," "End Year," "Start Month," etc.)

Use these sliders to determine the temporal range of the data to be displayed,
then click on the "Get Ship Data" button to retrieve the corresponding ship
data from the database.

* Data Points

Ship data points are pseudocolored according to the Ship Data color map and its
Min and Max values.  Hover over a data point to see the id for that data point
in the database, the currently selected variable and its value for that point,
the date on which the data was acquired, the cruise number, and its latitude and
longitude.

* Ship Data Color Map

By default, the Min and Max values are extracted from the currently loaded data
(for selected year and selected time period). You can change the Min and Max
values dynamically. If the value for a data point is less than the Min displayed
that data point will be colored black.  If that value is greater than the
displayed Max, it will be colored white.

Hovering over the Ship Data color map displays the preceding paragraph.

If you change the color map Min or Max values, then select another variable or
time period, the Min and Max values should return to those extracted from the
database.  

* Log in or Register

Currently not available.

* Error Checking

At this point, there is almost none.  Enter non-numeric characters where
meaningless, and who knows what will happen.

* Adding New Data or Changing Existing Data

This can currently be accomplished one data point at a time with the Add/Change
Ship Data page.  Access will soon be significantly restricted to these
capabilities (that's what the register and login stuff will be for), but right
now they're handy for testing by developers.  At this early stage, it's a matter
of a few seconds at this point to flush the database and restock it with clean
data, but please desist from monkeying with this capability.

* MySQL database structure
